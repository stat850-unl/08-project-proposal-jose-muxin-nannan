## Average salary of each position

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
player_salary <- read.csv("player_salary.csv",header = T)
posSa <- player_salary %>% group_by(player_salary$position) %>%
  summarise(avg <- mean(total_value))
posSa <- as.data.frame(posSa)
posSa[order(posSa$`avg <- mean(total_value)`,decreasing=T),]
```

## Number of players of each position

```{r pressure, echo = TRUE}
frequency <- player_salary %>% group_by(player_salary$position)%>%
  summarise(n = n())
frequency <- as.data.frame(frequency)
frequency[order(frequency$n,decreasing = T),]
```

## Average salary of each team
```{r, echo = TRUE}
teamSa <- player_salary  %>% group_by(player_salary $team) %>%
  summarise(avg <- mean(total_value))
teamSa <- as.data.frame(teamSa)
teamSa[order(teamSa$`avg <- mean(total_value)`,decreasing=T),]
```

## Average salary of each age group
```{r, echo = TRUE}
ageSa <- player_salary  %>% group_by(player_salary $age) %>%
  summarise(avg <- mean(total_value))
ageSa <- as.data.frame(ageSa)
ageSa[order(ageSa$`avg <- mean(total_value)`,decreasing=T),]
```


## Expolore total value among different age groups
```{r, echo=FALSE}
corAge <- ggplot(data=player_salary ,aes(x=age,y=total_value))+xlim(0, 70)+geom_point(color ="darkgreen")
corAge
```

## Is total value positively correlated with fully guaranteed?
```{r}
cor(player_salary$total_value,player_salary$fully_guaranteed)
corValue <- ggplot(data=player_salary ,aes(x=total_value,y=fully_guaranteed))+
  geom_point(color ="darkgreen")
corValue
```
